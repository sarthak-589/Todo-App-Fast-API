It is fast API Project Todos APP in which I have done Complete Crud operations and also done OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, OAuth2PasswordBearer in which we have to login using Username and Password and after all the API will call.

In this Project I have also used Alembic to do migrations.

Moreover, in this I have also done testing for Todos, admin, auth and users. But Users testing is not working properly.

To do testing u have to write this code in terminal =>> python -m pytest test/test_todos.py 
in place of todos u have to write admin, auth or users to do test.
